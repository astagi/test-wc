# Playing with Web Components

⚠️ This package has been made just for having fun and experimenting with Web Components.

⚠️ ⚠️ This repository may use part of [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and [Bootstrap Italia](https://github.com/italia/bootstrap-italia) source code, modified to support SSR. These projects are used only for experimental purpouses and not intended to be released in a real library (even though this library will be packaged and released on NPM)

### Why web components for a design system?

Enforcing a consistent set of design standards across teams and projects is much more challenging if you’re part of a larger organization— especially one with many distributed teams and concurrent projects, or hundreds of developers and designers. The problem is amplified when you consider the diversity of technologies and frameworks in use in most enterprises today, which makes it challenging to find a single approach that works for everyone on the team. One way to solve it is by building and implementing a design system using highly customizable, framework-agnostic Web Components!

### Web components VS Frameworks

Think of Web Components as the essential building blocks for web development. They allow you to create reusable custom elements that combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a cohesive unit. That’s it — simple, powerful, and focused. 

Framework ecosystems manage much broader application concerns: handling state, routing, data flow, and UI updates.
